This repository contains the dataset of the key wind field properties such as the friction velocity and the instantanous momentum flux as well as the dust emission fluxes caused by saltation bombardment (SALT) and those by convective-turbulent motions (CTDE) for all 14 simualtions that are used for the analysis and plots of the paper draft of Wagner et al. entitled as "The dust emission potential of agricultural-like fires - theoretical estimates from two conceptually different dust emission parameterizations" that is submitted to JGR.

The individual simulations are entitled as Fire_00 - Fire_13, whereby Fire_01 serves as a reference case that is also used to create Figure 1, while all other simulations deviate from it concerning the averaged geostrophic wind velocity, fire intensity, or fire size as indicated in the list below. Additionally, a non-fire simulation (Fire_00) similar to Fire_01 is included. All data are given as .nc-files.

Fire_00		NO-FIRE simulation, similar to Fire_01 but with no fire
Fire_01		mean ambient wind speed (geostrophic wind) of 3 m/s, F_Fire=150 kW/m2, A_Fire=7,000 m2; reference simulation, used for Figure 1 
Fire_02		as FIRE_01 but reduced geostrophic wind of 1 m/s
Fire_03		as FIRE_01 but reduced geostrophic wind of 2 m/s
Fire_04		as FIRE_01 but increased geostrophic wind of 4 m/s
Fire_05		as FIRE_01 but increased geostrophic wind of 5 m/s
Fire_06		as FIRE_01 but weaker fire intensity of 50 kW/m2
Fire_07		as FIRE_01 but weaker fire intensity of 75 kW/m2
Fire_08		as FIRE_01 but weaker fire intensity of 115 kW/m2
Fire_09		as FIRE_01 but stronger fire intensity of 270 kW/m2
Fire_10		as FIRE_01 but smaller burning area of 2,400 m2
Fire_11		as FIRE_01 but smaller burning area of 4,800 m2
Fire_12		as FIRE_01 but larger burning area of 11,700 m2
Fire_13		as FIRE_01 but larger burning area of 20,400 m2
